hgl-rs
======

``hgl-rs``, short for "gl helpers for Rust", provides some boilerplate for
working with OpenGL. I wrote it as part of my [graphics
course](http://web2.clarkson.edu/class/cs452/) at
[Clarkson](http://clarkson.edu/).

license
-------

``hgl-rs`` is available under the same license as Rust (dual Apache2/MIT)
